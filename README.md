# Dates - Frontend Exercise

This is a frontend practice project as per the project description.

##Project setup:
The project could be run on a local by npm install and npm run dev.
The online live version is hosted here: https://aroundhome-project.netlify.app/

##Project considerations:
The goal was to create a React+TypeScript based solution for the the exercise, minimizing the usage of additional packages.
Therefore it is made with CSS modules, although I'd prefer styled components in general.

As for state management, I chose not to include any extra state management methods or tools, but I could have added a React Context provider.

The JSON data processing takes place on the front-end, but ideally the back-end should provide the right format, or it should be formatted and cached on the backend.

##Further improvement possibilities
There are many things that could be refactored, such further organising the code, separating logic from view, creating more reusable components and optimising re-render.
Other than that, performance analysis, accessibility checks, tests, authorization, data submission to server could be added among UI/UX improvements.
